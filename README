This directory contains the UNITS Management Framework.

    The UNITS Framework is free software.  See the file COPYING for
copying permission.  See the file INSTALL for installation
instructions.

    UNITS was developed at Enbridge Pipelines Inc. by Perry Kundert,
but is based virtually verbatim on the fine work of Christopher Rettig
(rettigcd@bigfoot.com).  His original units management template is
included right in this distribution, unmodified, as a community
service, in the file "units_t.h".  You may even wish to use his
implementation, instead of mine!

    Therefore, all parts of this UNITS framework package, except the
"units_t.h" file, are distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE.  Christopher Retig's original "units_t.h" file is, of course,
distributed under its original license (as stated in the file).  Its
license also states that it may be "used for any legal purpose", and
since the GPL is legal, I am hereby redistributing his code, as
modified by me, under the GPL, with the "special exception" provision
taken directly from the GNU GCC distribution which allows for the use
of the C++ templates, macros and inline functions provided in this
distribution within non-GPL C++ code.  Please forward any questions,
suggestions or patches to <perry.kundert@enbridge.com>, or
<perry@kundert.ca>.
